# Vendors List

This is a project that I developed for the Snapp food! code challenge. It is a React.js application that renders a list of vendors using virtual list.
You can see the [live demo](https://vendors-list-sigma.vercel.app/), which is powered by Vercel.
It uses the following technologies:

- [Vite](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/): A fast and lightweight frontend tooling that provides a smooth developer experience.
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/lucas-mancini/react-app-readme-example): A superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions and enables catching errors early.
- [SCSS](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/README.md): A CSS preprocessor that allows writing more maintainable and modular styles.
- [Redux Toolkit](http://my-app.com): A toolkit that simplifies the development of Redux applications by providing utilities for common tasks such as creating actions, reducers, and selectors.
- [React Router]: A library that enables routing and navigation for React applications.
- [RTK Query]: A powerful data fetching and caching solution for Redux applications that eliminates the need to write any reducers or middleware.

## Features

- Renders a list of vendors using virtual list
- Pagination based on scrolling
- RTK query for data fetching
- Include a skeleton card loading animation until the data is fully loaded
- Using BEM in SASS
